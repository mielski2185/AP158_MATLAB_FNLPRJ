This project is entitled **Topological Analysis of Cancer Cell Structures Simulated in MATLAB for Radiation Dosage Calculation and Optimization**, a model that can simulate cancer cells with varying attenuation coefficients, experimentally determined alpha and beta values with accompanying photon, alpha, and beta particle bombardment to simulate radiation application and determine the cancer cells' survival rates, morphological effects for topological analysis of application of radiation to a small sample.
